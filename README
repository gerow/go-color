Package color implements some simple RGB/HSL color conversions for golang.

Adapted from
http://code.google.com/p/closure-library/source/browse/trunk/closure/goog/color/color.js
and algorithms on easyrgb.com.

To maintain accuracy between conversions we use floats in the color types.
If you are storing lots of colors and care about memory use you might want
to use something based on byte types instead.

Also, color types don't verify their validity before converting. If you do
something like RGBColor{10,20,30}.ToHSV() the results will be undefined. All
values must be between 0 and 1.
